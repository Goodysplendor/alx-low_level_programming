Object-like Macros
An object-like macro is a simple identifier which will be replaced by a code fragment. It is called object-like because it looks like a data object in code that uses it. They are most commonly used to give symbolic names to numeric constants.
The C preprocessor scans your program sequentially. Macro definitions take effect at the place you write them.
